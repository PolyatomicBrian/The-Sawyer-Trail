The-Sawyer-Trail
================
The Sawyer Trail was the first game I ever wrote in Java. I made this as part of my 11th grade Computer Science course in high school. The game itself is a parody of the popular 70s game, The Oregon Trail. I named the game after my awesome CS teacher, Mr. Sawyer.
In The Sawyer Trail, you take control of a party of 5 that is traveling in a school bus to a hack-a-thon. You must make sure the people in your party do not starve, all while you worry about the bus having enough fuel to finish the journey.
The game prides itself on its replayability, as no two games will ever be alike due to the factor of randomness. With humorous dialogue, a unique story, and hours of entertainment, it's no wonder all my classmates loved this game.

*Due to the fact that this was made when I was still a novice developer, the code ~~may~~ __will__ be cluttered, undocumented, and just an overall mess. You have been warned.*
